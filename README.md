# Golang Practice Projects

## Description

The Golang Practice Projects repository contains a collection of applications developed during an internship at NEss as a Golang Software Developer. These projects serve as a practice playground for learning and getting acquainted with the Golang language, its features, and its ecosystem. The repository includes projects such as `first_app`, `first_db_app`, `first_web_api`, and `first_web_api_v2`, where various aspects of Golang development are explored, including writing code, functions, controllers, database interactions, and more.

## Projects

- **first_app**: A basic Golang application serving as an introductory project, focusing on fundamental concepts and syntax of the language.
- **first_db_app**: An application that integrates with a database, providing hands-on experience with database interactions in Golang.
- **first_web_api**: A web API implemented in Golang, exploring the development of HTTP servers, routing, and handling requests and responses.
- **first_web_api_v2**: An enhanced version of the web API project, incorporating additional features and improvements.

## Key Learning Areas

- **Data Types and Structures**: Understanding and working with various data types and data structures in Golang.
- **Interfaces**: Implementing and utilizing interfaces for flexible and extensible code.
- **Functions**: Writing functions for code organization and reusability.
- **Concurrency**: Exploring concurrency features in Golang, such as goroutines and channels.
- **Database Interaction**: Interacting with databases using Golang's built-in database/sql package or ORM libraries.
- **HTTP Servers and APIs**: Developing HTTP servers and APIs for web applications using Golang's net/http package.

# NDE Roias Internship Go

## Description

The NDE Roias Internship Go project is an online-shopping API developed using Golang and MariaDB (MySQL). It represents a shopping cart system with various features including product storing, searching, filtering, user registration and login, shopping cart functionality (adding/removing items, modifying quantities), placing orders, and a review system. The project was a collaborative effort during an internship at Ness Digital Engineering, involving cooperation with another intern. Golang and MariaDB with MySQL were chosen as the primary technologies, with Bitbucket used for version control. Tasks were managed through Jira, and teamwork was essential to split tasks evenly and complete the project on time.

## Features

- **Product Management**: CRUD operations for managing products, including storing, searching, and filtering.
- **User Authentication**: User registration and login functionality for secure access to the system.
- **Shopping Cart**: Users can add/remove items from the cart, modify product quantities, and view their shopping cart contents.
- **Order Placement**: Ability to place orders for selected items in the shopping cart.
- **Review System**: Users can leave reviews for products, contributing to the overall product rating and feedback system.

## Technologies Used

- **Golang**: Backend development and API implementation.
- **MariaDB (MySQL)**: Database management for storing product, user, and order data.
- **Bitbucket**: Version control system for collaborative development and code management.
- **Jira**: Task management tool for organizing and tracking project tasks and progress.
